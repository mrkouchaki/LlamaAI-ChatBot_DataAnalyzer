# LlamaAI-ChatBot_DataAnalyzer

### Chat with Your Data using Llama3 LLM Model to Perform Data Analytics

---

## Overview

**LlamaAI-ChatBot_DataAnalyzer** is a cutting-edge project that enables you to interact with your data through natural language conversations powered by Meta's **LLaMA 3** model. This tool is designed to combine the power of a large language model (LLM) with practical data analytics, allowing users to upload datasets, ask questions about their data, and receive real-time insights and analyses. By leveraging **Hugging Face's** ecosystem and integrating with LLaMA, this project provides a great user experience for both conversational AI and advanced data analysis.
