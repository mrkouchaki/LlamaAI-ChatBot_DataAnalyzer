# LlamaAI-ChatBot_DataAnalyzer

### Chat with Your Data using Llama3 LLM Model to Perform Data Analytics

---

## Overview

**LlamaAI-ChatBot_DataAnalyzer** is a cutting-edge project that enables you to interact with your data through natural language conversations powered by Meta's **LLaMA 3** model. This tool is designed to combine the power of a large language model (LLM) with practical data analytics, allowing users to upload datasets, ask questions about their data, and receive real-time insights and analyses. By leveraging **Hugging Face's** ecosystem and integrating with LLaMA, this project provides a great user experience for both conversational AI and advanced data analysis.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- A Hugging Face account
- Access to the LLaMA 3 model (request access [here](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B))
- Hugging Face API token

### Installation


1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LlamaAI-ChatBot_DataAnalyzer.git
   cd LlamaAI-ChatBot_DataAnalyzer
```
2. **Install the required dependencies:**

```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. **Set up Hugging Face API Authentication:**

```bash
   # You can authenticate via the CLI:
   huggingface-cli login

   # Or set the API token in your environment:
   export HUGGINGFACE_HUB_TOKEN=your_access_token_here
```
4. **Run the chatbot:**

```bash
   python chatbot.py
```

## Usage

### General Chat Mode:
Engage in conversational queries with the chatbot powered by LLaMA 3. You can ask general questions or request data-related insights.

### Data Analytics Mode:
Upload a CSV file and interact with your data in real-time. Use the chatbot to extract statistical summaries, explore patterns, and analyze key metrics in your dataset.

### Example Interactions:

#### General Chatting:

```bash
User: Tell me about the LLaMA model.
Bot: LLaMA is a large language model developed by Meta, designed for high-performance...
```

#### CSV Data Interaction

```bash
User: Upload CSV file.
User: Can you give me the summary statistics of this dataset?
Bot: Here is the summary: (shows a table of summary statistics)
```
#### Configuration:

The model behavior can be configured using the config/model_config.py file. You can adjust parameters such as the maximum sequence length and tokenizer settings based on your specific requirements.

### Example Configuration (model_config.py):

```bash
MODEL_NAME = "meta-llama/Meta-llama-3-BB"
MAX_LENGTH = 100
```
